# Slate plugins

Collection of slate plugins, initially forked from great gitbook repositories.

> ⚠️ Ever since gitbook abandoned the original version of slate and decided to fork their own, some plugins have been greatly neglected.
> This is our attempt to bring these plugins up to date with latest versions of slate.
> Please note that we will accept pr with new plugins, but we won't accept requests for us updating plugins that we don't use in guestbell.
> Please note we've rewritten plugins in typescript and also made some changes that might cause api to be inconsistent.

## Demo

## Getting Started

Plugins are publish via scope ```@guestbell```, therefore to install, you do

## Tests

We have temporarily disabled testing on these plugins. In some bright future, we expect to fix them and reenable.

yarn start
